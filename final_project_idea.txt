					Final Project Idea

1. For my final project I hope to use existing fungal microbiome data and compare it using a custom database and the super computer at the University of Utah. 


2. I will find the data by looking for articles or data sets on NCBI/sra. I will try to find as many as possible, but I hope to find at least twenty. 

3. Code that will generate plot:

library(vioplot)
x1 <- mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl==4]
x2 <- mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl==6]
x3 <- mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl==8]
vioplot(x1, x2, x3, names=c("4% var", "6% var", "8% var"), 
        col="gold")
